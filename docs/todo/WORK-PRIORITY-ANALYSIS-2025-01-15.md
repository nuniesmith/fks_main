**Next Steps After**: Phase 4 (User Guidance) or Phase 5 (AI Optimization)

---

### Option 3: Test Current Implementation (VALIDATION)

**Why This Third?**
- ✅ **Validate Work**: Ensure Phase 2 works correctly
- ✅ **Identify Issues**: Find bugs before adding features
- ✅ **Quick Task**: 2-4 hours to test
- ⚠️ **May Block Progress**: If issues found, need to fix first

**Tasks**:
1. Start services and verify health (30 min)
2. Test data flow (30 min)
3. Generate test signals (30 min)
4. Test approval workflow (30 min)
5. Verify execution integration (30 min)

**Deliverable**: Validation report

**Next Steps After**: Fix issues or proceed to Phase 3
