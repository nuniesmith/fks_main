## 📝 Notes

- Some issues were created without labels because the "phase2" label doesn't exist yet
- You can add labels manually or create them first:
  ```bash
  gh label create "phase2" --repo nuniesmith/fks --description "Phase 2: Immediate Fixes" --color "0E8A16"
  gh label create "docker" --repo nuniesmith/fks --description "Docker related" --color "0E8A16"
  gh label create "health-checks" --repo nuniesmith/fks --description "Health check improvements" --color "0E8A16"
  ```
